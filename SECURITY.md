# Security Policy

This document describes the process for reporting security vulnerabilities in our website’s code base. Any user or developer who discovers what appears to be a security vulnerability is encouraged to report it to us as soon as possible following the instructions below.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions of our website:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

> **Note:** If you are using any unsupported versions (5.0.x or older than 4.0), please upgrade to a supported version as soon as possible, as they no longer receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a potential security vulnerability in our repository, please follow these guidelines to help us address the issue as quickly and efficiently as possible:

1. **Do Not Publicly Disclose:**  
   Avoid posting any details of the vulnerability publicly, including on GitHub, Twitter, or any other site until we have had a chance to address it. Public disclosure may expose users to potential harm.

2. **How to Report:**  
   Please send an email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) with the subject line “Security Issue Report” and include the following details:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - The impact assessment, including potential security implications.
   - Any additional data or context that might help us understand the issue.
   
3. **Confirmation & Response:**  
   Upon receipt of your report, our security team will send you an acknowledgment within 72 hours. We might reach out to you for additional information if necessary.

4. **Timeline for Fixes:**  
   We will work diligently to determine the validity and severity of the vulnerability. If the vulnerability is accepted, we commit to updating you on the progress at roughly 14-day intervals until a fix is released.

5. **Post-Fix Disclosure:**  
   Once the vulnerability has been fixed:
   - We will include a summary of the fix in our release notes.
   - If agreed upon, we may publish a detailed advisement detailing the vulnerability and the impact, ensuring that responsible disclosure practices are maintained.

## Acknowledgment

We greatly appreciate your efforts to responsibly report security vulnerabilities. Your cooperation helps us protect all our users and maintain the integrity of our project.

Thank you for contributing to the security of our website.
